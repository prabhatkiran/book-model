This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This is a sample React.JS based UI application to list all the books present in a book-model(or a book catalog). The application fetches data from API service and displays the data in a list format.


To run the application, one needs to install npm and node.js globally as a pre-requisite. Having done that, open a terminal window on your computer and browse to the cloned application's directory and execute command 'npm start'.

The above mentioned command will start the application on a local node.js server after successfull compilation of the code and the application will run on port:3000 on your locahost. Therefore, one can access the application in a browser at 'http://localhost:3000'
